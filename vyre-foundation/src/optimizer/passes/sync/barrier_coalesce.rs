//! `barrier_coalesce`  -  fold consecutive `Node::Barrier` runs into one.
//!
//! Op id: `vyre-foundation::optimizer::passes::barrier_coalesce`. Soundness:
//! `Exact` over the per-MemoryOrdering join rule documented in
//! `vyre-foundation::memory_model`. Cost-direction: monotone-down on
//! `node_count` and `control_flow_count`  -  never inserts a barrier; only
//! removes redundant ones. Preserves: every analysis. Invalidates: nothing
//! (the IR shape changes but downstream passes that care about barrier
//! placement only ask for the strictest barrier in each sequence).
//!
//! ## Rule
//!
//! When the IR contains a sequence `[..., Barrier(A), Barrier(B), ...]`
//! at the same scope (same parent body), the pair is replaced by a single
//! `Barrier(join(A, B))` where `join` is the MemoryOrdering join  -  the
//! stronger of the two. This is sound because two barriers in immediate
//! sequence with no intervening memory operations are equivalent to one
//! barrier of the stronger ordering: every guarantee of either is provided
//! by the join.
//!
//! Common after lowering passes that conservatively emit barriers around
//! every atomic, then rely on a coalesce pass to collapse runs.
//!
//! ## Ordering join (mirrors `effect_lattice::SyncScope::join`)
//!
//! - `Relaxed ⊔ X = X`
//! - `Acquire ⊔ Release = AcqRel`
//! - `AcqRel ⊔ X = AcqRel` (unless X is `SeqCst` or `GridSync`)
//! - `SeqCst ⊔ X = SeqCst` (unless X is `GridSync`)
//! - `GridSync ⊔ anything = GridSync`
//!
//! GridSync dominates because it's the only ordering that synchronizes
//! across blocks; absorbing weaker orderings into it is sound.

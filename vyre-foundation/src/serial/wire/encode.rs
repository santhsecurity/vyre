/// # Invariants

/// The output buffer is appended to only; no bytes are removed or

///
/// # Pre-conditions

/// The expression must use only enum variants that have a registered
/// stable wire tag. Variants added to `Expr` without an assigned
/// tag will fail encoding (audit L.1.27 / I4).

/// # Return semantics

/// * `Ok(())` – the expression was fully appended to `out`.
/// * `Err(String)` – an actionable diagnostic starting with `Fix:`
///   describing the unsupported variant or oversized payload.
///
/// # Failure modes
///
/// * **Unmapped variant** – `bin_op_tag`, `un_op_tag`, or
///   `atomic_op_tag` returns `Err` when the op has no wire tag.
/// * **String overflow** – `put_string` rejects names longer than
///   [`crate::serial::wire::MAX_STRING_LEN`].
/// * **Length overflow** – `put_len_u32` rejects argument counts
///   larger than `u32::MAX`.

/// # Return semantics

/// # Role

/// version, entry-op id, buffer table, work-group size, and entry
/// body.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// The output is a fresh `Vec<u8>`; the caller owns it. Capacity is
/// pre-allocated heuristically to avoid reallocations on typical
/// programs, but the vector grows naturally if the estimate is low.
///
/// # Pre-conditions
///
/// The program must use only enum variants that have stable wire
/// tags. A well-formed program should always encode successfully;
/// encoding failure signals either an unsupported variant
/// (audit L.1.27 / I4) or a field that exceeds wire-format bounds
/// (audit I10).

/// # Return semantics
///
/// * `Ok(Vec<u8>)` – a complete VIR0 blob starting with
///   [`crate::serial::wire::framing::MAGIC`] and
///   [`crate::serial::wire::framing::WIRE_FORMAT_VERSION`].
/// * `Err(String)` – an actionable diagnostic starting with `Fix:`.
///
/// # Failure modes
///
/// * **Buffer count overflow** – more than `u32::MAX` buffers.
/// * **String overflow** – buffer names or the entry op id longer
///   than [`crate::serial::wire::MAX_STRING_LEN`] are rejected.
/// * **Unmapped variant** – `access_tag`, `put_data_type`, or nested
///   `put_expr` / `put_node` calls fail when an enum variant has no
///   wire tag.
///
/// # Versioning
///
/// The version bytes are emitted immediately after the magic

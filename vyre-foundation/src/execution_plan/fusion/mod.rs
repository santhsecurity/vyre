#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]
//! Fuse multiple independent Programs into a single combined Program.
//!
//! This is the cross-dispatch fusion layer that the megakernel builder and
//! rule-composition pipeline use to collapse sibling dispatches into one
//! kernel body.  It is **not** the expression-level fusion pass
//! (`optimizer::passes::fusion`)  -  that pass lives inside one Program.
//!
//! Audit-fix A31 split this module into:
//!  - `mod.rs`: crate-level attribute + error types + module decls/re-exports
//!  - `fuse.rs`: `fuse_programs` family + multi-program implementation
//!  - `collectors.rs`: `collect_*_targets_*` walkers
//!  - `divergence.rs`: divergence + invocation-gate analysis
//!  - `helpers.rs`: misc small helpers
//!  - `tests.rs`: full proptest + unit-test suite
//!
//! # Safety invariants
//!
//! * Every buffer name that appears in more than one arm is treated as the
//!   *same* physical GPU buffer. The caller must ensure this is intentional.
//! * Access-mode upgrades are applied automatically (`ReadOnly` -> `ReadWrite`)
//!   when any arm needs to write.
//! * A `Node::Barrier` is inserted between arms when a later arm writes a
//!   buffer that an earlier arm reads, preventing write-after-read corruption.
//! * Programs marked `non_composable_with_self` cannot be fused with another
//!   copy of the same `entry_op_id`.

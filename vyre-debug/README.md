# vyre-debug

`vyre-debug` is the static diagnostic and inspection toolkit for the Vyre 0.4.2 megakernel ecosystem.

## Overview

This crate provides tools to validate, diff, and inspect Vyre's intermediate representation (IR) at the descriptor level, ensuring that passes like `vyre-lower` and `vyre-emit-naga` behave correctly. It is heavily utilized by `vyre-bench` and internal fuzzing infrastructure to catch regressions in descriptor equivalence and detect invalid control-flow rewrites.

## Features

- **Dangling Reference Detection:** Inspects nested `KernelBody` structures to catch references to SSA IDs that are out of scope, accounting for inherited results and completed child body variables.
- **Descriptor Diffing:** Compares two kernel descriptors (e.g., before and after an optimization pass) and generates a structured summary of changes (dropped bindings, added bindings, operation counts).
- **WGSL Emission Inspection:** Wraps `vyre-emit-naga` to provide validated, line-numbered WGSL dumps for any `Program` or `KernelDescriptor`.
- **Carrier Tracing:** Identifies loops without valid loop carriers and summarizes reads/writes for debugging `loop_carry` and `bank_conflict` rewrites.

## Command Line Interface

The crate provides the `vyre-dbg` executable for interactive debugging. It operates on a registry of hardcoded test fixtures.

```bash
# Dump the generated WGSL for the 'loop_carry_smoke' fixture
cargo run --bin vyre-dbg -- dump-wgsl --prog loop_carry_smoke --lines

# Check for dangling SSA references
cargo run --bin vyre-dbg -- find-dangling --prog c11_extract_calls --num-tokens 8

# Compare descriptors before and after lowering passes
cargo run --bin vyre-dbg -- diff-lower --prog c11_extract_calls --num-tokens 4
```

## Architecture

As part of the Santh monorepo architecture, `vyre-debug` adheres to strict tier separation. It provides both a reusable library for agent-driven fuzzing and a standalone tool (`vyre-dbg`) for operational config. 

All diagnostics are structured and support JSON emission (`--json`) for automated regressions.

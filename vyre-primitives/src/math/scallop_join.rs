//! `scallop_join`  -  Scallop-style probabilistic Datalog join, GPU-resident.
//!
//! Compiles a Datalog fixpoint into GPU-resident dispatch phases by
//! emitting a Lineage-semiring relational join. Small matrices use a
//! block-local convergence loop; large matrices expose split-visible
//! GridSync phases for multi-block CUDA dispatch. The output cell
//! `C[i,j]` is the bitset union of clauses
//! participating in any `i ⇝ j` derivation through one join step.
//!
//! # Why ship this as a named primitive instead of "compose them yourself"
//!
//! Two reasons:
//!
//! ## (a) The fixpoint contract
//!
//! Datalog fixpoint converges when no new fact is derived. Under the
//! Lineage semiring that means no clause-bitset OR'd into any cell
//! flips a 0 bit to 1  -  the canonical convergence signal `next ==
//! current` per word. `scallop_join` packages the Lineage transfer and
//! convergence loop together so callers do not re-derive that the
//! Lineage semiring's monotonic OR-accumulator is safe with ping-pong
//! equality convergence. Other semirings would NOT be safe  -  `MinPlus`
//! accumulators decrease over iterations, which the equality check would
//! treat as "changed = 1" indefinitely until the absolute minimum settles.
//! So the recursion-thesis-clean wrapper is the contract:
//!
//! > "scallop_join is exactly the Datalog-shaped, monotone,
//! >  GPU-resident Lineage fixpoint."
//!
//! ## (b) Two consumers, recursion thesis closed from day 1
//!
//! - **User dialect consumer**: probabilistic Datalog programs (Scallop
//!   programs compile each rule body to one `scallop_join`). Substrate
//!   for neuro-symbolic reasoning systems.
//! - **vyre-self consumer**: rule-provenance tracking for external analyzer / any
//!   substrate that needs to ask "which input rule produced this output
//!   finding?" The answer is a Datalog query over (rule_id, derives,
//!   finding_id), and `scallop_join` is the GPU-resident execution.
//!   See [`crate::math::scallop_join::PROVENANCE_SELF_CONSUMER`].
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! ```text
//! initial:    R[0]   = adjacency matrix encoding source → target
//!                      facts; cell is the bitset of clauses introducing
//!                      that edge (Lineage encoding).
//! transfer:   R[t+1] = R[t] ⊗_Lineage A_join,  where A_join is the
//!                      static join-rule adjacency. Combine = "OR
//!                      participating clauses across one path step",
//!                      Accumulate = "OR alternative derivations into
//!                      the same cell."
//! converge:   stop when R[t+1] == R[t] per cell.
//! ```
//!
//! Each cell is a single u32 bitset of clauses (capacity 32). Multi-word
//! lineage belongs in a distinct `scallop_join_wide` op so larger clause
//! sets have their own schema; this primitive is the canonical
//! single-word version with the contract test that distinguishes "no
//! edge" from "edge with empty clause set" via the zero-absorbing
//! combine.
//!
//! # Wiring contract
//!
//! Caller supplies:
//!
//! - `state`: `n × n` cell buffer (ReadWrite). Initialized by caller
//!   with the seed facts; mutated to fixpoint by the dispatch.
//! - `next`: `n × n` scratch buffer (ReadWrite). Reused as the
//!   ping-pong target between fixpoint iterations.
//! - `join_rules`: `n × n` static join-rule adjacency (ReadOnly).
//!   `join_rules[i,j]` is the clause bitset that, when present at
//!   `state[i,k]` and `join_rules[k,j]` for some k, derives a fact at
//!   `state[i,j]`.
//! - `changed`: 1-word convergence flag (ReadWrite, atomic OR).
//! - `n`: matrix dimension (relations encoded as n × n cells).
//! - `max_iterations`: hard upper bound (Datalog fixpoint is monotone
//!   so converges in ≤ n^2 iterations; cap at a safety multiple).
//!
//! # CPU reference
//!
//! [`crate::math::scallop_join::cpu_ref`] performs the same fixpoint iteration on host arrays and
//! is the parity oracle for every GPU dispatch.

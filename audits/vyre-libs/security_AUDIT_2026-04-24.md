# DEEP AUDIT  -  vyre-libs::security module (kimi, 2026-04-24)

> Target: 40+ findings. Depth, not breadth.

---

## bounded_by_comparison.rs

[CRITICAL] bounded_by_comparison.rs:23  -  backward reachability on DOMINANCE edges is not dominance; SURGE's `bounded_by_comparison` predicate expects "cmp dominates use" semantics, but this op computes ancestors in the dominance tree (reverse of descendants). Fix: replace `csr_backward_traverse` with the Cooper-Harvey-Kennedy intersection primitive from `vyre-foundation::transform::compiler::dominator_tree`.

[HIGH] bounded_by_comparison.rs:5  -  doc comment claims "every access is reachable backward along dominance edges from some bound check," which describes ancestors, not the descendant relation the stdlib actually needs. Fix: rewrite doc to match the real (broken) semantics or fix the primitive and update the doc.

[MEDIUM] bounded_by_comparison.rs:32  -  test fixture uses only self-loops, so convergence is trivial and never exercises multi-hop backward traversal. Fix: add a chain fixture where node 3 is reachable from node 0 via two dominance hops and assert the fixpoint reaches all ancestors.

[MEDIUM] bounded_by_comparison.rs:38  -  fixture hardcodes DOMINANCE mask (16) but never mixes other edge kinds, so a mask bug would not be caught. Fix: add a fixture with mixed edge kinds and assert only dominance edges are followed.

[HIGH] bounded_by_comparison.rs:54  -  `ConvergenceContract::max_iterations` is hardcoded to 64 with no justification; deep dominance trees (>64 levels) silently truncate and produce false negatives. Fix: derive max_iterations from `shape.node_count` or document a proven upper bound.

## dominator_tree.rs

[CRITICAL] dominator_tree.rs:18  -  emits backward reachability, not iterative intersection; SURGE's `dominates` predicate is therefore semantically broken (reports reachability, not true dominators). Fix: delegate to `vyre_foundation::transform::compiler::dominator_tree::relax_step_program` which implements CHK intersection.

[HIGH] dominator_tree.rs:3  -  doc comment falsely claims "Dominator computation is a fixpoint over reverse reachability"; dominators require intersection of predecessor dominator sets, not union. Fix: delete the comment and replace the op body with the CHK step primitive.

[MEDIUM] dominator_tree.rs:27  -  test fixture is copy-pasted from `bounded_by_comparison` (self-loops only) and cannot detect missing intersection semantics. Fix: add a diamond-CFG fixture where node 3 has two predecessors; without intersection the op would incorrectly include non-dominating ancestors.

[HIGH] dominator_tree.rs:49  -  `max_iterations: 64` is insufficient for tall dominance trees; convergence will silently abort on deep call chains. Fix: set max_iterations equal to `shape.node_count` or switch to the CHK primitive which converges in RPO order.

[HIGH] dominator_tree.rs:18  -  `dominator_tree` and `bounded_by_comparison` emit identical IR (same primitive, same mask) yet register different OP_IDs and claim different semantics; this is an op-id behavior collision. Fix: delete the duplicate shim or give it a distinct, correct implementation.

## flows_to.rs

[CRITICAL] flows_to.rs:29  -  `allow_mask` is `0xFFFF_FFFF`, traversing CONTROL, DOMINANCE, and future edge kinds, directly contradicting `surgec/rules/stdlib/flows_to.srg` which restricts to assignment/call_arg/return/phi/field/mut_ref. Fix: pass the dataflow mask `ASSIGNMENT | CALL_ARG | RETURN | PHI | ALIAS | MEM_STORE | MEM_LOAD | MUT_REF` (0x17F).

[HIGH] flows_to.rs:9  -  doc comment references the stdlib edge-kind lattice but the primitive ignores it, making the doc a registration lie. Fix: update the doc or change the mask to match the lattice.

[MEDIUM] flows_to.rs:38  -  test fixture is a 4-node chain and only validates one forward step; it does not test fixpoint convergence, cycle handling, or sanitizer interaction. Fix: add a multi-hop fixture requiring 3+ iterations to reach the sink.

[MEDIUM] flows_to.rs:48  -  `fout seed` is initialized to the same value as `fin`, masking idempotency bugs because the OR step is not tested against a zeroed output buffer. Fix: initialize `fout seed` to `0b0000` so the test must prove the step actually adds nodes.

[HIGH] flows_to.rs:62  -  `max_iterations: 64` truncates reachability on long interprocedural dataflow chains (>64 hops), causing false negatives at internet scale. Fix: derive the bound from the actual graph diameter or use `shape.node_count`.

## label_by_family.rs

[MEDIUM] label_by_family.rs:23  -  build closure uses `family_mask = 0xFFFF_FFFF` (all families), so the fixture cannot distinguish specific-family resolution from a no-op. Fix: use a specific mask (e.g., `0b0010`) and assert only matching nodes are set.

[MEDIUM] label_by_family.rs:24  -  `test_inputs` and `expected_output` are `None`, so the universal harness never exercises this shim; a parameter-order swap would go undetected. Fix: add a fixture that exercises the shim's parameter mapping.

[LOW] label_by_family.rs:16  -  `node_count` is passed unchecked to `resolve_family`; zero produces a zero-count buffer that backends may reject. Fix: add an early `assert!(node_count > 0, "Fix: node_count must be positive.")`.

## path_reconstruct.rs

[HIGH] path_reconstruct.rs:16  -  `max_depth` is an unbounded `u32`; a hostile caller passing `u32::MAX` causes an infinite GPU loop (shader hang until watchdog kills the dispatch). Fix: add a compile-time cap `const MAX_MAX_DEPTH: u32 = 1_048_576` and assert in the builder.

[MEDIUM] path_reconstruct.rs:36  -  expected_output compares full padded path from `cpu_ref`, but the IR only writes `len` elements; backends that do not zero-fill RW buffers will return garbage tail bytes, causing flaky conformance failures. Fix: pad the IR body with explicit zero stores for indices `len..max_depth`.

[MEDIUM] path_reconstruct.rs:28  -  test fixture only exercises the happy path (target=3, parent=[0,0,1,2]); it does not test OOB target or cyclic parent arrays. Fix: add adversarial fixtures for target >= parent.len() and a 2-cycle parent array.

[LOW] path_reconstruct.rs:24  -  build closure hardcodes `max_depth = 4` with no relationship to actual parent buffer size. Fix: validate `max_depth <= parent_buffer_element_count` at build time or document the invariant.

## sanitized_by.rs

[CRITICAL] sanitized_by.rs:51  -  `sanitizers_in` parameter is completely ignored (`let _ = sanitizers_in;`), so taint flows through sanitizer nodes unchecked, breaking the zero-FP contract. Fix: compose `bitset_and_not(frontier_in, sanitizers_in, frontier_clean, words)` before the traversal step.

[CRITICAL] sanitized_by.rs:78  -  expected_output `0b0011` includes node 1, which is explicitly marked as the sanitizer in the fixture, encoding the bug as the test oracle. Fix: after implementing sanitizer masking, change expected_output to `0b0001`.

[HIGH] sanitized_by.rs:18  -  doc comment claims "Soundness: Exact on a sound sanitizer catalog" while the implementation is a no-op with respect to sanitizers. Fix: delete the false claim or implement the masking.

[HIGH] sanitized_by.rs:33  -  doc comment says the emitted Program AND-NOTs sanitizers, but the Program never declares a `sanitizers_in` buffer, so the driver cannot bind sanitizer data. Fix: declare the buffer in the emitted IR and actually use it.

[MEDIUM] sanitized_by.rs:64  -  test comment claims second-step sanitizer blocking is exercised in the surge stdlib fixpoint test, but the shim-level fixture does not test it; if the primitive breaks, the stdlib test failure is far from the root cause. Fix: add a two-step fixture at the shim level where the sanitizer blocks propagation past hop 1.

[HIGH] sanitized_by.rs:52  -  same all-edge mask (`0xFFFF_FFFF`) as `flows_to`, allowing taint to bypass sanitizers via CONTROL or DOMINANCE edges even if the sanitizer subtraction were implemented. Fix: restrict the mask to dataflow edges only.

[MEDIUM] sanitized_by.rs:58  -  build closure passes `"san"` for `sanitizers_in` but the emitted Program has no such buffer binding; the harness provides the bytes but the primitive ignores them. Fix: declare the buffer in the Program and compose the mask.

## taint_flow.rs

[CRITICAL] taint_flow.rs:14  -  `allow_mask` is `0xFFFF_FFFF`, including CONTROL and DOMINANCE edges, so taint reachability is massively over-approximated and will drown true positives in false-positive noise at internet scale. Fix: restrict to dataflow edge kinds.

[MEDIUM] taint_flow.rs:23  -  test fixture uses trivial self-loops, never exercising multi-hop taint propagation or convergence. Fix: replace with a linear chain requiring multiple fixpoint steps.

[HIGH] taint_flow.rs:10  -  doc claims stdlib composes this for the "full taint-flow matrix," but the unrestricted edge mask pollutes the matrix with control-flow reachability. Fix: update the doc or restrict the mask.

[HIGH] taint_flow.rs:45  -  `max_iterations: 64` is too small for deep interprocedural taint chains; silently truncates reachability. Fix: bound by `shape.node_count` or use a proven diameter estimate.

## topology.rs

[LOW] topology.rs:20  -  `#[deprecated]` alias lacks a forwarding `#[inline]` hint, so every call site pays an extra function frame in debug builds. Fix: add `#[inline]` to the deprecated wrapper.

[LOW] topology.rs:15  -  re-exports `MAX_CACHED_POSITIONS` and `MAX_DEPTH` from `range_ordering`, keeping a coupling between the security module and a non-security module. Fix: remove the re-exports and direct callers to `range_ordering`.

## mod.rs

[MEDIUM] mod.rs:7  -  module doc claims "All security ops compose GPU-parallel graph algorithms," but `label_by_family` is a tag bitmap scan and `topology` is a deprecated alias, neither of which is a graph algorithm. Fix: rewrite the module doc to accurately describe the contents.

[LOW] mod.rs:27  -  comment references `AUDIT_CLAUDE_2026-04-24 F7` but this audit file is named `AUDIT_2026-04-24.md` and authored by kimi; the cross-reference is to an audit that does not exist in the repo. Fix: remove the temporal self-reference or rename the file to match.

[MEDIUM] mod.rs:20-26  -  re-exports bare functions without builder wrappers, missing the `TensorRef` dtype/shape/uniqueness validation that other vyre-libs domains (math, nn) provide. Fix: add `BoundedByComparisonBuilder`, `FlowsToBuilder`, etc., that validate buffer names and shapes.

## Cross-cutting / Primitive issues observable in security shims

[CRITICAL] flows_to.rs:29  -  `csr_forward_traverse` does not bounds-check `dst < node_count` before `atomic_or` into `frontier_out`; a malformed `edge_targets` buffer causes OOB writes if validation is skipped or stale. Fix: add an IR bounds guard `Expr::lt(dst, Expr::u32(shape.node_count))` before the atomic.

[CRITICAL] dominator_tree.rs:18  -  `csr_backward_traverse` loads `frontier_in` at `dst_word_idx = dst / 32` without checking `dst < node_count`; malformed graphs cause OOB reads. Fix: add an IR guard `Expr::lt(dst, Expr::u32(shape.node_count))` before the load.

[HIGH] flows_to.rs:29  -  `bitset_words(shape.node_count) = (node_count + 31) / 32` overflows for `node_count > 0xFFFFFFE0`, producing a zero-count output buffer while dispatching `node_count` threads, causing every lane to write OOB. Fix: use `node_count.div_ceil(32)` or `checked_add(31).unwrap_or(u32::MAX) / 32`.

[HIGH] dominator_tree.rs:18  -  same `bitset_words` overflow as `flows_to` because all graph shims share the unchecked helper. Fix: harden `bitset_words` against overflow in `vyre-primitives`.

[MEDIUM] path_reconstruct.rs:18  -  `cpu_ref` pads unwritten tail elements with zeros, but the IR body does not, creating a CPU↔GPU divergence for unwritten buffer slots. Fix: emit zero-fill stores for indices `len..max_depth` in the IR body.

[HIGH] topology.rs:25 (via range_ordering.rs:105)  -  `match_order` computes `a_end = a_start + a_len` with unchecked u32 addition; hostile offset+length pairs can wrap to small values and invert the ordering predicate. Fix: use `Expr::add_checked` or `Expr::select(Expr::ge(a_end, a_start), a_end, Expr::u32(u32::MAX))`.

[MEDIUM] topology.rs:25 (via range_ordering.rs:33)  -  `packed_load` computes `id * MAX_CACHED_POSITIONS + index` with unchecked u32 multiply; large `id` values wrap and index incorrect buffer slots. Fix: clamp `id` to a safe range or use checked multiply.

[HIGH] sanitized_by.rs:51  -  ignoring `sanitizers_in` means the `ConvergenceContract` tests convergence of pure forward reachability, not sanitizer-masked reachability; the contract tests the wrong semantics. Fix: implement sanitizer masking and update the fixture to prove convergence under masking.

[MEDIUM] label_by_family.rs:17  -  `resolve_family` computes `(node_count + 31) / 32` with the same overflow bug as the graph primitives; this shim passes `node_count` through unchecked. Fix: validate `node_count <= 0xFFFFFFE0` in the shim or harden the primitive.

[MEDIUM] bounded_by_comparison.rs:23  -  `csr_backward_traverse` loads `NAME_EDGE_OFFSETS[src+1]` without validating `src+1 < node_count+1` at the IR level; while validation should catch this, the IR is not defensive. Fix: add a runtime trap or assert in the IR for the edge_offsets load.

[HIGH] taint_flow.rs:14 / flows_to.rs:29 / sanitized_by.rs:52  -  all three shims use `0xFFFF_FFFF`, but the SURGE stdlib `flows_to.srg` enumerates only six dataflow edge kinds; the mismatch means the GPU semantics diverge from the source-language semantics. Fix: define a shared `DATAFLOW_MASK` constant in `vyre-primitives::predicate::edge_kind` and use it in every taint shim.

[MEDIUM] path_reconstruct.rs:28  -  test fixture uses `parent = [0,0,1,2]` which is a tree, but does not test a DAG parent array where node 3 has two parents; the IR stores only one parent per step. Fix: add a DAG fixture and document that `path_reconstruct` emits the first found path, not all paths.

[HIGH] dominator_tree.rs:18 / bounded_by_comparison.rs:23  -  both ops delegate to `csr_backward_traverse` with `edge_kind::DOMINANCE`, but the primitive does not verify that the DOMINANCE bit is actually set in the graph's `edge_kind_mask`; if surgec emits a graph with DOMINANCE edges missing, the ops silently return empty sets instead of failing with a clear error. Fix: add a pre-dispatch validation that at least one DOMINANCE edge exists when this op is used.

[LOW] flows_to.rs:62 / taint_flow.rs:45 / sanitized_by.rs:86 / dominator_tree.rs:49 / bounded_by_comparison.rs:54  -  all five `ConvergenceContract`s use the same magic number 64 with no comment explaining the choice. Fix: document the provenance of 64 or make it a named constant `DEFAULT_FIXPOINT_BUDGET`.

[MEDIUM] mod.rs:20-26  -  security shims lack `FixpointRegistration` (only `ConvergenceContract`), so `lens_parity.rs`'s fixpoint backend-parity test skips them entirely, leaving a blind spot in automated GPU verification. Fix: register `FixpointRegistration` with the correct flag buffer name, or extend `lens_parity.rs` to handle `ConvergenceContract` ops.

[MEDIUM] path_reconstruct.rs:18  -  the primitive's IR uses `Expr::buf_len(parent)` for bounds checking, but `buf_len` returns the declared count; if the runtime buffer is smaller than declared, the select returns `current` (no load), but the caller receives no error. Fix: emit a runtime trap when `current >= buf_len(parent)` instead of silently returning `current`.

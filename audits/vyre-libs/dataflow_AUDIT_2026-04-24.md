## Findings

### ssa.rs

[CRITICAL] ssa.rs:25  -  `ssa_construct` returns `Program::empty()` scaffold; mod.rs claims DF-1 underpins every other primitive. Fix: implement Cytron dominance-frontier phi insertion and variable renaming, or delete the module per LAW 1.
[CRITICAL] ssa.rs:12  -  `OP_ID` is defined but no `inventory::submit!` for OpEntry, violating mod.rs line 34 claim that all ten primitives register. Fix: submit OpEntry with fixture or remove the false claim.
[HIGH] ssa.rs:20  -  `ssa_construct` lacks `#[must_use]` while the three non-scaffold dataflow functions have it. Fix: add `#[must_use]` to all public composition functions for consistency.
[MEDIUM] ssa.rs:7-8  -  Doc claims `Exact` for SSA construction, but without a body the claim is unverifiable. Fix: remove unverifiable precision claim until body lands.

### points_to.rs

[CRITICAL] points_to.rs:23  -  `andersen_points_to` returns `Program::empty()` scaffold; IFDS and callgraph docs claim dependency on DF-3 for soundness. Fix: implement Andersen inclusion constraints or delete per LAW 1.
[CRITICAL] points_to.rs:17  -  No OpEntry registration despite stable OP_ID and mod.rs claim that all ten primitives register. Fix: register OpEntry with witness fixture.
[CRITICAL] points_to.rs  -  No ConvergenceContract registration; Andersen is an iterative fixpoint analysis requiring bounded iteration. Fix: submit ConvergenceContract with a sound max_iterations bound.
[MEDIUM] points_to.rs:9  -  Doc claims `Sound` but body is `Program::empty()`; claim is unverifiable. Fix: remove claim or implement body.

### callgraph.rs

[CRITICAL] callgraph.rs:28  -  `callgraph_build` returns `Program::empty()` scaffold; IFDS docs claim dependency on DF-5 for soundness. Fix: implement direct + indirect edge construction or delete.
[CRITICAL] callgraph.rs:20  -  No OpEntry registration. Fix: register OpEntry with witness fixture.
[CRITICAL] callgraph.rs  -  No ConvergenceContract; callgraph construction iterates over indirect edges. Fix: submit ConvergenceContract.
[HIGH] callgraph.rs:22  -  `_points_to_in` parameter is named but unused by the empty body; there is no integration path for points-to results to feed callee resolution. Fix: implement indirect-dispatch resolution consuming the points-to input.
[MEDIUM] callgraph.rs:14  -  Doc claims `Sound` but body is `Program::empty()`; claim is unverifiable. Fix: remove claim or implement body.

### slice.rs

[CRITICAL] slice.rs:25  -  `backward_slice` returns `Program::empty()` scaffold. Fix: implement backward data/control dependence walk or delete per LAW 1.
[CRITICAL] slice.rs:16  -  No OpEntry registration. Fix: register OpEntry with witness fixture.
[CRITICAL] slice.rs  -  No ConvergenceContract; backward slicing is a fixpoint over data/control dependencies. Fix: submit ConvergenceContract.
[HIGH] slice.rs:18  -  Takes `_reach_in` and `_callgraph_in` but no `points_to_in`, yet docs say DF-3 points-to is a dependency. Fix: add points-to buffer parameter.
[MEDIUM] slice.rs:12  -  Doc claims `Sound` but body is `Program::empty()`; claim is unverifiable. Fix: remove claim or implement body.

### range.rs

[CRITICAL] range.rs:26  -  `range_propagate` returns `Program::empty()` scaffold. Fix: implement interval abstract domain or delete per LAW 1.
[CRITICAL] range.rs:19  -  No OpEntry registration. Fix: register OpEntry with witness fixture.
[CRITICAL] range.rs  -  No ConvergenceContract; range propagation requires widening/narrowing loop. Fix: submit ConvergenceContract.
[MEDIUM] range.rs:13-15  -  Doc claims `Sound` in "standard abstract-interpretation sense" but body is `Program::empty()`; claim is unverifiable. Fix: remove claim or implement body.

### escape.rs

[CRITICAL] escape.rs:22  -  `escape_analyze` returns `Program::empty()` scaffold. Fix: implement closure over parameter/return/global reachability or delete.
[CRITICAL] escape.rs:15  -  No OpEntry registration. Fix: register OpEntry with witness fixture.
[CRITICAL] escape.rs  -  No ConvergenceContract. Fix: submit ConvergenceContract.
[HIGH] escape.rs:17  -  `_points_to_in` and `_callgraph_in` parameters are named but unused by the empty body. Fix: implement the analysis consuming its declared inputs.
[MEDIUM] escape.rs:8  -  Doc claims `Sound` but body is `Program::empty()`; claim is unverifiable. Fix: remove claim or implement body.

### summary.rs

[CRITICAL] summary.rs:25  -  `summarize_function` returns `Program::empty()` scaffold; docs claim this is the performance gate for ~450k Linux functions. Fix: implement bottom-up summary computation or delete.
[CRITICAL] summary.rs:17  -  No OpEntry registration. Fix: register OpEntry with witness fixture.
[CRITICAL] summary.rs  -  No ConvergenceContract; bottom-up summary computation is inherently iterative. Fix: submit ConvergenceContract.
[MEDIUM] summary.rs:13  -  Doc says "Soundness: inherited from the underlying primitives" but there is no `Soundness` enum marker in the doc comment, violating the module-wide contract. Fix: add explicit Soundness marker.

### loop_sum.rs

[CRITICAL] loop_sum.rs:22  -  `loop_summarize` returns `Program::empty()` scaffold. Fix: implement widening/narrowing fixpoint acceleration or delete.
[CRITICAL] loop_sum.rs:15  -  No OpEntry registration. Fix: register OpEntry with witness fixture.
[CRITICAL] loop_sum.rs  -  No ConvergenceContract; loop summarization IS a fixpoint accelerator. Fix: submit ConvergenceContract.
[MEDIUM] loop_sum.rs:10  -  Doc claims `Sound` but body is `Program::empty()`; claim is unverifiable. Fix: remove claim or implement body.

### reaching.rs

[CRITICAL] reaching.rs:30  -  Doc claims `Exact` but reaching-definitions is a classical may-analysis that over-approximates. Fix: change Soundness marker to `Sound`.
[CRITICAL] reaching.rs:32-33  -  Doc contradicts itself: claims `Exact` but mandates a downstream filter "that confirms each reaching def actually affects the sink". Fix: reconcile docstring with dataflow theory or downgrade to `Sound`.
[CRITICAL] reaching.rs:91  -  Test `expected_output` asserts `0b0001` for one forward step from node 0 in a diamond graph, but `csr_forward_traverse` produces `0b0110` (nodes 1 and 2). Fix: correct expected_output to match actual primitive semantics.
[HIGH] reaching.rs:59  -  `reaching_defs_step` passes `0xFFFF_FFFF` allow_mask, traversing all edge kinds including dominance/call/return edges indiscriminately. Fix: filter to CFG edge kinds via `edge_kind` constants.
[HIGH] reaching.rs:54  -  Module name and docs claim "reaching definitions" but the function emits a generic forward traversal with no gen/kill transfer function. Fix: rename to `cfg_forward_step` or add the transfer body.

### live.rs

[CRITICAL] live.rs:14  -  Doc claims `Exact` but live-variables is the backward dual of reaching-defs, inherently a may-analysis. Fix: change Soundness marker to `Sound`.
[CRITICAL] live.rs:46  -  Test fixture `pg_edge_targets` provides 3 edges (12 bytes) but `ProgramGraphShape::new(4, 4)` allocates for 4 edges (16 bytes), causing reference interpreter failure on `universal_cat_a_harness`. Fix: change shape to `new(4, 3)` or pad fixture to 4 edges.
[HIGH] live.rs:29  -  `live_step` uses `csr_forward_traverse` for backward analysis instead of `csr_backward_traverse`, relying on undocumented caller behavior to flip edges. Fix: use `csr_backward_traverse` directly.
[HIGH] live.rs:29  -  `live_step` passes `0xFFFF_FFFF` allow_mask, traversing all edge kinds. Fix: filter to data/control dependence edge kinds.
[MEDIUM] live.rs:46  -  Test seeds `fin=fout=0b1000` (node 3) in a forward chain where node 3 has no outgoing edges, so the test would pass trivially without exercising backward propagation even if buffer sizes matched. Fix: use a reversed graph and assert propagation to predecessors.

### ifds.rs

[CRITICAL] ifds.rs:18  -  Doc claims `Exact` given three assumptions, but the body is a bare `csr_forward_traverse` with no super-graph explosion, no call/return matching, no sanitizer masking. Fix: implement IFDS/IDE semantics or downgrade claim to `Sound`.
[CRITICAL] ifds.rs:69  -  Test `expected_output` asserts `0b0001` for one forward step from node 0 in chain 0→1→2→3, but `csr_forward_traverse` sets bit 1 yielding `0b0010` (or `0b0011` accounting for seed). Fix: correct expected_output.
[CRITICAL] ifds.rs:64  -  Test fixture `pg_edge_targets` provides 3 edges (12 bytes) but `ProgramGraphShape::new(4, 4)` allocates for 4 edges (16 bytes). Fix: change shape to `new(4, 3)` or pad fixture.
[HIGH] ifds.rs:46  -  `ifds_reach_step` takes only `shape, frontier_in, frontier_out` with no `points_to_in` buffer, yet docs say DF-3 points-to is required for soundness. Fix: add points-to buffer parameter.
[HIGH] ifds.rs:51  -  `ifds_reach_step` passes `0xFFFF_FFFF` allow_mask, breaking IFDS call/return matching semantics. Fix: use edge_kind masks appropriate to super-graph edges.
[HIGH] ifds.rs:46  -  Module name and docs claim "IFDS/IDE interprocedural dataflow framework" but the function emits a generic forward traversal with no super-graph semantics. Fix: rename to `supergraph_forward_step` or implement exploded super-graph.

### mod.rs

[HIGH] mod.rs:34  -  Comment claims "All ten primitives register via `inventory::submit!`" but only 3 of 10 have OpEntry registrations and only 3 have ConvergenceContracts. Fix: register remaining 7 primitives or update comment.

## Summary

- **8 / 10 primitives** return `Program::empty()` today (scaffold status): `ssa`, `points_to`, `callgraph`, `slice`, `range`, `escape`, `summary`, `loop_sum`.
- **3 / 10 primitives** have `inventory::submit!` OpEntry registrations: `reaching`, `live`, `ifds`.
- **3 / 10 primitives** have `ConvergenceContract` registrations: `reaching`, `live`, `ifds`.
- **2 primitives** (`reaching`, `live`) falsely claim `Exact` in docs while being may-analyses.
- **1 primitive** (`ifds`) falsely claims `Exact` while shipping a generic forward traversal.
- **2 test registrations** (`live`, `ifds`) have buffer-size mismatches (3 edges in fixture vs 4 in `ProgramGraphShape`) that cause reference-interpreter failures.
- **2 test registrations** (`reaching`, `ifds`) have `expected_output` values that do not match the semantics of `csr_forward_traverse`.
- **1 test registration** (`live`) would pass trivially even with correct sizes because the chosen sink node has no outgoing edges.
- **0 files** exceed 400 lines (LAW 7 file-size boundary is respected).
- **Integration gap:** `ifds` and `slice` declare DF-3 points-to as a soundness dependency but accept no points-to buffer parameter.

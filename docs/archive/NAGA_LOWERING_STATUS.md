# Naga Lowering Status

Closes #29 A.5 (naga lowering  -  zero holes) at the documentation
level; the remaining code-level holes are tracked under #171 F-NAGA.

## The contract

Every `vyre::ir::*` construct lowers to a valid naga `Module` through
`vyre-emit-naga`, or returns a `LoweringError` whose `Fix:` hint names
the missing path. Silent-correctness failures (the NAGA_DEEPER
CRITICAL category) are specifically excluded  -  an unsupported
op/type MUST reject, never "work by accident."

## Closed holes

Landed before the S12 migration and now owned by `vyre-emit-naga::program`:

| Finding | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| NAGA_HOLES F01, F10, F11, F21 | `_ =>` catch-alls on `#[non_exhaustive]` enums silently accepted future variants. | Removed or replaced with loud `Err`. |
| NAGA_HOLES F06 | `Expr::Atomic` result type hard-coded to `u32_ty`. | Correct type derived from operand. |
| NAGA_HOLES F07, F08, F09 | `AtomicOp::{CompareExchangeWeak, FetchNand, Opaque}` rejected. | Lower directly or route through registered extension. |
| NAGA_HOLES F19, F20, F22 | `Node::{AsyncLoad, AsyncStore, AsyncWait, Trap, Resume}` silently skipped; `If` didn't validate boolean condition. | Dedicated arms + bool-coercion guard. |
| NAGA_DEEPER F52 | Array stride silently defaulted to 4 when `size_bytes()` was None. | Reject with LoweringError naming the buffer. |
| NAGA_DEEPER F53 | `Expr::Cast { target: U64 }` fell through to generic unsupported_type error. | Named rejection for the current portable WGSL contract. |
| NAGA_DEEPER F54 | `emit_bool_from_handle` rejected F32  -  callers had to insert manual comparisons. | Accept F32 via `f32 != 0.0`. |
| NAGA_DEEPER F59 (CRITICAL) | `BinOp::Add` on U64 silently wrong (componentwise vec2 with no carry). | Reject arithmetic binops on U64/I64 under the current portable WGSL contract; bitwise + equality remain allowed. |
| F-ADV labels | TOML parse poison + mis-categorised sanitizer families. | Label file normalisation landed. |

## Source-change findings

Tracked under #171 F-NAGA:

- NAGA_HOLES F02, F03, F04  -  `Expr::SubgroupBallot/Shuffle/Add`
  fast-path unification (naga 24 gating workaround).
- NAGA_HOLES F13  -  `Expr::BufLen` on workgroup buffers emits
  invalid `ArrayLength` (needs static length from `BufferDecl.count`).
- NAGA_HOLES F14  -  `Expr::Fma` assumes F32 regardless of operand
  types (needs dtype dispatch).
- NAGA_HOLES F15  -  `Node::Region` silently flattens into parent
  block (loses the Region wrapper  -  structurally OK but loses
  debugger provenance; `print-composition` still sees the chain
  through `Ident::generator`).
- NAGA_HOLES F16  -  `Node::Barrier` emits combined
  `STORAGE|WORK_GROUP` for every barrier; should be scoped.
- NAGA_HOLES F17/F18  -  `Node::Loop` double-evaluates `to` + loses
  saved body on the error path.
- NAGA_HOLES F23-F26  -  scalar type rejection breadth (Bytes,
  Array, Vec2U32, Vec4U32 preregistration).

## Gate

`cargo test -p vyre-driver-wgpu --tests` must pass green before any
release tag. `naga_deeper_regressions.rs` locks the silent-
correctness fixes (F52/F53/F54/F59). The gate fails loudly if any of
those regress.

## Operating rule

New IR variants must land with a naga lowering arm in the same PR, or
with an explicit rejection that names the unsupported construct. A
variant with neither is a correctness bug.

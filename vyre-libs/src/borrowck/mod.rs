//! Front-end-agnostic borrow-check engine.
//!
//! This module is the borrow checker's brain and its stable contract. The
//! [`BorrowFacts`] IR is the neutral input that any front-end produces; the
//! [`analyze`] engine consumes only that IR and never depends on a parser,
//! resolver, or rustc. That separation is what lets the borrow checker run on
//! real repos today (a rustc adapter produces facts) and run standalone later
//! (our own front-end produces the same facts) without the engine changing.
//!
//! The analysis is a control-flow dataflow (NLL loan liveness) over the CFG, so
//! it is correct across arbitrary control flow (branches included) and is the
//! fixpoint the weir GPU backend evaluates batched across a whole crate. The
//! fact schema is modeled on the Polonius input facts and is extended over time
//! (regions, moves, ...) without breaking the engine's dependents.
//!
//! The CPU [`analyze`] engine is the reference; [`gpu::analyze_batched`]
//! computes the identical verdict on a device, batched across all loans.

//! GPU borrow checker: the NLL loan-liveness verdict computed on a device via
//! batched reachability, producing the identical [`Conflict`] set as the CPU
//! [`analyze`](super::analyze) engine.
//!
//! The CPU engine's two monotone bitset dataflows are equivalent to per-loan
//! reachability: a loan's issue reaches a point iff the point lies in the
//! forward closure of `{issue}` over the CFG; a use is reachable from a point
//! iff the point lies in the forward closure of the loan's uses over the
//! reversed CFG; the loan is live where both hold. Two loans of one place
//! conflict when one is live at the other's issue and at least one is mutable.
//!
//! [`analyze_crate_batched`] is the scale engine: it unions every function's
//! CFG into one *disconnected* graph (disjoint node ranges, so a closure can
//! never cross a function boundary) and runs every loan in the whole crate
//! through **two** device dispatches: one forward-batch seeded at every loan's
//! issue, one backward-batch seeded at every loan's uses. Launch overhead is
//! amortized across the entire crate, not per function and not per loan, which
//! is what makes a crate-scale borrow check GPU-fast. [`analyze_batched`] is the
//! single-function case. Both are backend-agnostic: the caller supplies an
//! [`OptimizerDispatcher`], which on the fleet is the CUDA backend.
//!
//! Memory scales as `total_loans * ceil(total_points / 32)` words; for very
//! large crates the function list is sharded into groups before dispatch (each
//! shard is still two dispatches), which the caller controls by chunking.

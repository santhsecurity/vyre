//! vyre-driver  -  substrate-agnostic backend machinery.
//!
//! Registry, runtime, pipeline, routing, diagnostics, and the VyreBackend
//! trait. Concrete backend crates depend on this crate and contribute
//! lowerings via the inventory collection mechanism.

// missing_docs is enforced workspace-wide via [workspace.lints.rust].
// vyre-driver inherits that floor; do not re-allow it here.

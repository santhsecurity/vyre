# conform/

Conformance = certifiable parity between every vyre backend and the
CPU reference interpreter.

If WGSL emits `7.0`, SPIR-V emits `7.0`, and `vyre-reference` emits
`7.0` for the same program, the op conforms. If any one disagrees,
even by a single bit, the op is non-conformant and no backend is
allowed to ship.

The four crates in this directory cooperate to enforce that
guarantee end to end.

A fifth crate, `vyre-test-harness`, holds the shared CPU/GPU lens
and fixture loader used by both the runner and any backend crate's
dev-dependencies. It exists to break the dev/normal cross-link that
used to couple backend crates to the runner.

## Invariants

1. **Witness sets are deterministic.** `WitnessSet::enumerate()`
   produces the same sequence in the same order on every run; the
   enumeration is part of the conformance contract.
2. **Law verdicts are structural.** `LawVerdict::Failed` carries the
   counterexample tuple that proved the failure: no hashing, no
   summarisation. A law failure is reproducible byte-for-byte from
   the verdict alone.
3. **Minimization converges.** `CounterexampleMinimizer` halves the
   u32 input on every step and terminates in `O(log n)` calls; it
   never loops and never returns a larger counterexample than the
   input.
4. **No backend ships without a green matrix.** CI blocks publish on
   `vyre-conform-runner`'s matrix returning zero divergences.
5. **No exemptions.** The `UniversalDiffExemption` registry has been
   removed. Tolerance for approximate ops is encoded in
   `OpEntry::tolerance()` (e.g. ULP budgets for transcendental kernels).
   Every other op must match byte-for-byte or fail the matrix. There is
   no skip path for missing fixtures, capabilities, or known failures.

## Boundaries

This directory owns:

- The witness enumeration contract and the default `U32Witness`.
- The law prover that consumes witnesses and op compose functions.
- The counterexample minimizer.
- The CI runner that wires everything together and emits a bundle
  certificate.
- The shared test harness (lens + fixtures).

It does NOT own:

- The ops themselves (those live in `vyre-foundation`,
  `vyre-primitives`, `vyre-libs`, `vyre-intrinsics`).
- The CPU reference evaluator (`vyre-reference`).
- Backend implementations (`vyre-driver-wgpu`, `vyre-driver-spirv`).
- The benchmark harness (`vyre-runtime` + criterion harnesses in
  each crate).

## Per-crate READMEs

- `vyre-conform-spec/README.md`: witness sets, `WitnessSet` trait,
  `U32Witness`.
- `vyre-conform-enforce/README.md`: `LawProver`, `LawVerdict`,
  algebraic-law checks.
- `vyre-conform-generate/README.md`: `CounterexampleMinimizer`
  binary-search shrinker.
- `vyre-conform-runner/README.md`: the CI runner, parity matrix,
  and bundle certificate flow.
- `vyre-test-harness/README.md`: shared lens + fixtures between
  runner and backend dev-deps.

## Extension guide: adding a DataType / law / backend to conformance

1. **New DataType witness**: implement `WitnessSet` for the type in
   `vyre-conform-spec`; the enumeration order is part of the public
   contract, so pick it once and document why.
2. **New algebraic law**: add a variant to `LawVerdict` and the
   corresponding proof pass in `LawProver`; add at least three
   counterexample tuples that are known to fail for a broken op, and
   assert the prover finds them.
3. **New backend**: register the backend with `vyre-driver`, then
   add a matrix row in `vyre-conform-runner`'s parity matrix
   fixture. The runner will diff your backend's dispatch against the
   CPU reference automatically.
4. **Tolerance contracts**: for ops whose contracts already permit
   backend-defined drift (e.g. `softmax`, `attention`), set the ULP
   tolerance in the `OpEntry` registration. All other ops must reach
   byte-identity across every backend.

See `vyre-conform-runner/tests/parity_matrix.rs` for the end-to-end
wiring and `vyre-conform-enforce/src/prover.rs` for the verdict
shape.

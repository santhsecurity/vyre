//! Interprocedural callee-before-caller pass dispatch via #74 level_wave (#74 self-consumer).
//!
//! Closes the recursion thesis for #74  -  `level_wave_program` ships to
//! user dialects (whole-schema migrations, BFS layering, breadth-first
//! graph rewrites) AND drives vyre's interprocedural pass dispatch
//! when callees must finish before callers start.
//!
//! # The self-use
//!
//! Every interprocedural pass that walks a call graph has the same
//! shape: visit each function in callee-before-caller order, run a
//! per-function body, barrier between depth waves. Without
//! `level_wave_program`, each backend hand-codes that loop on the
//! host (one dispatch per depth, host-side termination check). With
//! it, the entire BFS becomes one Program and one dispatch.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. Caller computes per-function depth in the call graph (leaves at
//!    depth 0, increasing toward main).
//! 2. Caller hands `step_body` (the per-function rewrite/analysis body)
//!    plus the depth array to `build_callee_before_caller_program`.
//! 3. Returned Program runs the body for every function at depth `d`,
//!    barriers, then advances to depth `d+1`  -  all in one dispatch.
//! ```
//!
//! P-DRIVER-10: every interprocedural callee-before-caller pass should
//! consume this rather than hand-rolling a host depth loop.

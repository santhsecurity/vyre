//! Substrate-aware-but-backend-agnostic analyses on `KernelDescriptor`.
//!
//! Source-of-truth: `SEPARATION_AUDIT_2026-05-01.md` section S3 +
//! `PERF_ROADMAP_2026-05-01.md` section B.3.
//!
//! Each analysis here operates on a `KernelDescriptor` post-lowering
//! and pre-emission. Any rewrite they produce is consumed by every
//! emitter, so analyses that work this layer pay off across all
//! substrates with one implementation.
//!
//! Substrate-specific emission patterns live in their respective
//! emitter crates instead.
